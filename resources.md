Obviously, we are not the first thinking about mobility data. This is a list of resources provided by third parties that
might be useful for this project.

* ## MDM
  [Germanyâ€™s Market Place for Mobility Data](https://www.mdm-portal.de/?lang=en) - With the MDM platform, the
  Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI) offers suppliers and users of mobility data everything
  they need to move forward: A neutral B2B platform. Defined standards for data exchange. Above all, the nationâ€™s
  biggest volume of information on traffic flows, traffic jams, road works, mobility options, parking facilities and
  more.

* ## Mobilithek

  [Germany's platform for data that move things](https://www.bmvi.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/DG/mobilithek.html) - The
  Mobilithek will play a central role as a National Access Point within a comprehensive mobility data ecosystem. As a
  cloud-based infrastructure with a web portal, high-performance support for the exchange of real-time data and a
  digital
  space for the development of data-based apps, it will cooperate closely with the Mobility Data Space, which is also
  currently being developed, and exchange data with it. This is made possible by the International Data Space (IDS)
  technology used by both systems.

  From 2023, the MDM and the mCLOUD will gradually merge into the Mobilithek. Until then, the Mobilithek builds on the
  two
  platforms:

    * The [Mobility Data Marketplace (MDM)](https://www.mdm-portal.de/?lang=en) is operated by the Federal Highway Research
      Institute (BASt) on behalf of the Ministry and currently assumes the role of the National Access Point. The main
      focus is on dynamic data from the area of road traffic.
    * The [mCLOUD ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª](https://www.mcloud.de/) is the ministry's open data portal and is operated by the ITZBund on behalf
      of the ministry. All data in the mCLOUD can be openly reused. Much of the data comes from authorities of the
      Ministry, from the mFUND funding programme and from open data portals of the federal states and municipalities.
